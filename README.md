This application is called the "Team-Profile-Generator". I needed a node.js console application that could generate programming-team profiles based on different types of questions, and how you answer them.
I use technologies like Node.js and packages downloaded to add functionality to node.js.
When you start the app you are asked to input what type of employee you are creating a profile for with the first multiple choice question.
Then, you fill in the other info of that employee with one question input after another (name, email, ID...).
By default you are given the option to exit and generate HTML for the profiles you create. Once you finish putting in as many profiles as you want, you can select the tap for exiting and generating the HTML, and it should create an HTML using bootstrap card templates to display the profiles on the webpage.
